<p>This website provides additional materials for the paper "Dynamic late reverberation rendering using the common-slope model" submitted to the 6th International Conference on Audio for Games.</p>

<p>The following video demonstrates rendering with the proposed system based on the common-slope model. The rendering in the video only includes the late reverberation synthesized with the modal reverberators.</p>

<p>In this video, the rendering includes direct sound and early reflections from the simulations (first 50 ms of the RIR). The late reverberation is still synthesized with the modal reverberators (RIR after 50 ms).</p>
